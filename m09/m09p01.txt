address of kernel allocated for the DLL path    :   0x00c80000
address of locatio nof the LoadLibraryA()       :   0x76d8395c

PAGE_READWRITE      :   0x04
                        Enables read-only or read/write access to the committed region of pages. 
                        If Data Execution Prevention is enabled, attempting to execute code in the committed region results in an access violation.

PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS  :   0x000F0000 | 0x00100000 | 0xFFF
                        All possible access rights for a process object

VIRTUAL_MEM         :   0x1000 
                        Allocates memory charges (from the overall size of memory and the paging files on disk) for the specified reserved memory pages. 
                        The function also guarantees that when the caller later initially accesses the memory, the contents will be zero. 
                        Actual physical pages are not allocated unless/until the virtual addresses are actually accessed.
                        0x2000   
                        Reserves a range of the process's virtual address space 
                        without allocating any actual physical storage in memory or in the paging file on disk.

h_loadlib           :   we use h_loadlib to resolve the memory address where LoadLibraryA() lives ,
                        so that we can point the subsequent CreateRemoteThread() call to its memory location
